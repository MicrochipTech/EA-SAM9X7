# SAM9X7 SoC and SiP Series
## Early Access Repository
The SAM9X7 Series microprocessors are high-performance and cost-optimized Arm926EJ-S CPU-based embedded microprocessors (MPU), running up to 800 MHz. The devices integrate powerful peripherals for connectivity and user interface applications, including MIPI DSI, LVDS, RGB and 2D graphics, MIPI-CSI-2, Gigabit Ethernet with TSN and CAN-FD. Advanced security functions are offered, such as tamper detection, secure boot, secure key storage, TRNG, PUF as well as high-performance crypto accelerators for AES and SHA. The SAM9X7 Series is supported by Microchip MPLAB®-X development tools, Harmony, Linux® distributions and the Ensemble Graphics Toolkit.
